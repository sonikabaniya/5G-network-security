1) Network Slicing 

2) Virtualization 

3) Exponential growth of 5G 

 --------

1) Network Slicing: 

 - Misconfiguration 

     - Example of misconfiguration given as:  the vendor had configured the firewall incorrectly and it was protecting the internet and not the client. It is refer to this as vendor persistent threat, like advanced persistent threat. 

     - Side Channel Attack 

2) Virtualization: 

- Having a risk of machine running an operating system 

- Having access to the machine running in it. 

- Isolated challenge and on top of that machine is running a hypervisor that itself can have vulnerabilities.  

- Hypervisor which manages virtual machines in a virtualized env can be prime target for attackers. 

- If compromised, an attacker can gain control over multiple VMs, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and unauthorized access to sensitive information 

- exposure of APIs used in network function virtualization. APIs facilitate communication between different network functions and services. But if not properly secured, they can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. This can lead to data leakage, service outages, and potential manipulation of network functions. 

 

3) Growth of 5G: 

- more and more devices get connected via 5G. This results in a much larger attack surface, and anything connected can, and in many cases does, carry a risk. Like with anything, we are only as secure as our weakest endpoint.
