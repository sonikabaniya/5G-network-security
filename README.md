# 5G-network-security
This repository is my lecture notes from online course '5G Network Security' from Kevin Cardwell. All the resources and their credit goes to the team that curated the course.

I took this online course as part of background study for my thesis. These notes are raw and probably not grammatically perfect but goal here is to document the learnings from this course.
